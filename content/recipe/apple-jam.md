## Method

1. Scale and kernel of the apples. Place the peeled apple slices in a bowl of cold water so that they do not darken.
2. Lift the apples to a saucepan and add water. Boil on low heat and stir regularly. Stir the sugar when the apples soften (feel a test piece). Let boil again.
3. Mix the mash to the desired consistency with a rod mixer.
4. In the fridge the mash stays for 1-2 weeks. In freezer it will last up to a year.
